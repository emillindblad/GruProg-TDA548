**** Exercises week 2 ***

Your profile
------------
- If you're new to programming, do as many exercises as possible, 1 is useful for lab1,
  2 and 3 will prepare for lab2. You can't spend all your time on exercises, both lab 1
  and 2 need time and are mandatory. Decide when to switch. Do left over exercises later
  or as exam recap.
- If experienced I think at least some of the later exercises will be a bit challenging

NOTE: Some exercises uses JavaFX. Possibly must check Edit Configurations ...
to have the correct path and JavaFX modules, see course page > Resources >
Java, JavaFX och IntelliJ

Exercises
---------
1.  See Ex1ReadPlayers. Implement the exercise to run like:

    How many players? > 2
    Name for player 1 > Olle
    Name for player 2 > Fia
    Players are:
    Name Olle points 0         (Player default have 0 points)
    Name Fia points 0

    a) Add a constructor to the Player class. The constructor should make it possible to set
    the name of the player when the player object is created.

    b) Implement methods inputPlayers() and outputPlayers(). Use the constructor when initializing!

    AGAIN: When mixing numerical and text input you have to remove the trailing enter key
    ('\n') in input stream when reading numbers. Use an extra sc.readLine() to fix.


2.  See Ex2ArrayMethod. Implement methods. In general program should just print "true".
    The only exception is the shuffle method. Method uses Random, so hard to test.
    Print out for shuffle should look something like:

    [0, 0, 1, 0, -1, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]     (randomly ordered elements)
    [-1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1]
    [-1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 1, -1, 1, 0, -1]
    [-1, -1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 1, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    [1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
    [1, 1, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
    [-1, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1]
    [1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1]
    ...

    See code for comments.

3.  See Ex3MatrixMethods. Implement methods so that program prints true for everything.
    Use functional decomposition if things getting too complex.

4.  See Ex4Theory. Just uncomment (possibly run) and explain result (write it here)
    1.  (write short explanation)
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.

5.  Ex5GameOfLife. Implement a simulation of "Game of Life", see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
    and https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/

    This is s graphical program, all graphics already implemented using JavaFX,
    you don't need to do (or understand) any graphics coding (but is simple and fun ...).

    NOTE: If any problems with graphics. Go to Canvas > course page > Resurser >
    Java, JavaFX och IntelliJ. See section Koppla ihop JavaFX och IntelliJ.

    a) Implement the init() method. The method should create and initialize the world with Cells
       (a square matrix with Cells). See code.

       - Sketch a plan and discuss with assistant before implementing!

    b) Now implement the update() method. The method should calculate the next state for all
       Cells in the world (using the rules).
       Method called automatically by a timer, don't need to call it. Rendering will be done automatically

       - If new: Make a plan! Discuss with assistants
       - Extensive use of testing! See comments and test() method.


6  See Ex6ThreeSumToZero. Write a method that given a sorted array of integers checks if any three of
   the elements has the sum 0. If so, the indices for the (first) elements found are returned as an array.
   If not, the empty array is returned.
   NOTE: The method must be efficient i.e. not use more than 2 nested loops!
