Exercise 1 ans 2 prepare for lab 4.
Exercise 3 (theory) is important **WILL** show up on exam!

Exercises
---------

1.  See ex1inheritance. Implement classes Vehicle, Car and Van to make program TestCarVan print the below.
    Let Car anv Van inherit from Vehicle and override the toString()-method. All data should be set in constructors.
    All data should be private. There should be NO redundant code.

    Description of classes:
    - A Car has an id, a top speed and an owner (a Person).
    - A Van has an owner (a Person), a max cargo and an id.

    A run of the program should look like:

    Car{topSpeed=160.0{owner=Person{id='123', name='olle'}, id='abc'}}
    Van{maxCargo=400.0{owner=Person{id='456', name='fia'}, id='def'}}
    Car{topSpeed=210.0{owner=Person{id='456', name='fia'}, id='ghi'}}
    Van{maxCargo=800.0{owner=Person{id='123', name='olle'}, id='jkl'}}

    TIP: Possible for IntelliJ to generate constructors and toString()

2.  See ex2asteroids. A sketch of the Asteroids game,
    see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game). This is a JavaFX program.

    The application is functioning, you should just refactor. Run class AsteroidsGUI!
    Use arrow keys! Refactor the classes to remove redundancy. Create common abstract base classes.
    Each base class should reflect one "kind" of objects (not everything i one base class).
    All data should be private so need setter/getters.

3.  See ex3theory. For each file, see file header comments.
