- These exercises are not strictly necessary for any lab. Will improve your general
  programming skills. If new to programming prioritize exercises week2 and lab2.
  Do left over exercises later or as exam recap. If stuck or curious or for any other
  reason write down and BRING QUESTIONS TO LECTURE!

Exercises
---------

1.  See Ex1LoopPuzzlers. For a) use loops, arithmetic and " " to print a multiplication table.
    For b) and c) write loops that print out the "patterns" (just start of patterns shown,
    they are in principle infinite). You may only use loops, out.println(), out.print(),
    with no args or with arguments "X" or " " (space).

        XXXXXXXXXX
         XXXXXXXXXX
          XXXXXXXXXX
           ....



2.  See Ex2ArrayMethods. Make program print true for all calls. If methods too
    complex, break down.

3.  See Ex3Theory. Uncomment and run each section. Explain result. Write explanation here
    1.
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.

4.  See Ex4MedianKthSmallest. Implement methods that calculate the median and the kth smallest
    of an integer array. See comments.
    Hint: It's useful to do pre-calculations to simplify the main task!

5.  See Ex5PointOfEquality. Implement method diffIndex() so that all output prints true.
    Hint: Overloading

6.  See Ex6GenericMethods.

    Create generic methods for diffIndex (from above), array shuffling and sorting.
    I.e. the methods should be able to handle any reference type array.

    Some references:
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/methods.html
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/boundedTypeParams.html

7.  See Ex7LCRSimulation. Implement a simulation of the dice game LCR,
    see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCR_(dice_game). The main task is to apply
    functional decomposition to get a well structured program. Draw a diagram before
    starting to implement!

    The simulation should run like:

    Simulation starts
    olle:3 fia:3 pelle:3
    olle got [L, ., C]
    olle:1 fia:3 pelle:4
    pelle got [C, R, .]
    olle:2 fia:3 pelle:2
    fia got [C, C, L]
    olle:3 fia:0 pelle:2
    olle got [., ., L]
    olle:2 fia:0 pelle:3
    pelle got [L, ., .]
    olle:2 fia:1 pelle:2
    fia got [C]
    olle:2 fia:0 pelle:2
    olle got [., C]
    olle:1 fia:0 pelle:2
    pelle got [., L]
    olle:1 fia:1 pelle:1
    fia got [R]
    olle:1 fia:0 pelle:2
    olle got [L]
    olle:0 fia:0 pelle:3     (finished, pelle is winner)
