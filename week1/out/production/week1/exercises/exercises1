**** Exercises week 1 ***

Welcome to exercises 1! Please read the below carefully.

Preparation
-------------
Create a directory named tda548 on the Z:\-drive. Use it to store all exercises and labs
(if don't have, close this project, create directory, move project)

NOTE: Possibly needed to access Z:\-drive from Linux
see https://it.portal.chalmers.se/itportal/StuDATLinux/FileServ

Fix code formatting keyboard shortcut
----------------------------------
Go to Canvas course page > Resources > Java, JavaFX och IntelliJ > "Ändra Kortkommandon".
Do it! Important!

NOTE: Most important shortcut : Ctrl z  (= undo!!!)

General instructions
----------------------
- Files for the exercises are in directory src/exercises (i.e. files you write Java code in).
- Last in the file header comment (the gray text) for each file is a "See: ..." reference.
  This means there are code samples in the src/samples directory to help you.
  The samples are all possible to run (right click in file > Run), modify, experiment, etc.
- If stuck, don't spend too much time on a single exercise, try another one ...
- If confused or problems to understand, ... write down and BRING QUESTIONS TO THE LECTURE!

Your profile
------------
- If you're new to programming, do as many exercises as possible (at least 1-6), to prepare
  for lab1. *BUT*, you can't spend all your time on exercises, lab1 need time and is mandatory.
  Decide when to switch. Do left over exercises later or as exam recap.
  Also: You could work in parallel with lab and exercises.

- If you're more experienced you decide what to do, possibly start with lab1.
  NOTE: Do check that you really *understand* the exercises!

Exercises
---------

1.  See Ex1BMI. Implement a program to calculate body mass index. Program should run be like:

    Please, enter your weight (kg) > 76
    Please, enter your height (m) > 1.85
    BMI = 22.205989773557338

2.  See Ex2EasterSunday. Program run should be like:

    Input a year (1900-2099) > 2017
    Easter Sunday for 2017 is : 16/4

    TIP: http://www.wheniseastersunday.com/

3.  See Ex3SumAvg. Write a program that calculates sum and average for an arbitrary (finite)
    number of positive integers. You should use a while-loop. Program should run like:

    > 5
    > 2
    > 3
    > -1         (-1 used to end input)
    Sum = 10 Avg = 3.3333333333333335

4.  Se Ex4Arrays. Implement a program like below. You should use an array to store the values and
    a for-loops to process.

    Input 5 integers (space between, then enter) > 4 2 6 1 9
    Array is [4, 2, 6, 1, 9]
    Input a value to find > 1
    Value 1 is at index 3         (if not found prints: Value not found)

5.  See Ex5Methods. Implement the methods (uncomment on row at the time). Program run should
    run like:

    true       (NOTE: this is the normal output when testing)
    true
    true
    true
    true
    true
    true
    Winner is Olle         (this is an exception to the normal output)

6.  See Ex6ClassObjects. Use the class Hero to create 2 heroes (hero objects) to be use like:

    What's the name of the hero 1? > Hercules      (input data)
    How strong is Hercules > 34
    What's the name of the hero 2? > Atlas
    How strong is Atlas > 45
    Atlas is stronger

    NOTE: When reading a number the scanner will leave the last char (the enter char, '\n') because
    it can not be part of any number. To get rid of the enter char use an extra sc.readLine().
    Else strange behaviour for program (seems like it skips an input).

7.  See Ex7RPS. Implement a program for the game Rock, Paper and Scissor.
    NOTE: The main task here is to use smallest step programming.
    You don't need any methods for this, put all code in program().

    The game should run as (just 5 rounds):

    Welcome to Rock, Paper and Scissors
    Select 1, 2 or 3 (for R, P or S) > 1
    Computer choose: 2
    You won
    Result 1                                (use an int for over all result, +1 for human, total = 1)
    Select 1, 2 or 3 (for R, P or S) > 2
    Computer choose: 2
    A draw
    Result 1
    Select 1, 2 or 3 (for R, P or S) > 3
    Computer choose: 1
    You won
    Result 2                                (result, +1 for human, total = 2)
    Select 1, 2 or 3 (for R, P or S) > 1
    Computer choose: 1
    A draw
    Result 2
    Select 1, 2 or 3 (for R, P or S) > 2
    Computer choose: 1
    Computer won
    Result 1                        (total = 1 -> i.e. total positive -> human won)
    Game over!
    Human won.

8.  See Ex8DayNumber. Implement a program that calculates the day number for a given year.
    NOTE: Main task here is functional decomposition. Assume a top level method and decompose.
    Test any non trivial method!

    If new to programming: Make a plan and discuss with assistant before staring to implement!

    Program should run like:

    Input the year > 2018
    Input the month number > 8
    Input the day number > 27
    Ordinal number for 27/8 in 2018 is: 239
    2018 is not a leap year

    TIP: See web how to calculate leap year.

9. See Ex9TicTacToe. Implement the Tic Tac Toe game.
   Here you should use functional decomposition and testing.

   If new to programming: Make a plan and discuss with assistant before staring to implement!

   Program should run like:

   Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, board is ...
   - - -             (<-- empty board)
   - - -
   - - -
   Player is olle(X)
   Select position to put mark (0-8) > 0

   X O X
   O X O
   - - -
   Player is olle(X)
   Select position to put mark (0-8) > 6
   Game over!
